# Task 1: ðŸŒ— Theme Toggle App using useReducer

## ðŸš€ Description

This project demonstrates a theme toggle feature built with React's `useReducer` hook. It showcases how to manage complex state transitions (like toggling themes) in a predictable, centralized way.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Centralized state logic using `useReducer`
- Toggles between Light and Dark themes
- UI updates dynamically based on the current theme
- Clean and minimal code structure

## ðŸ§ª How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/theme-toggle-useReducer.git

cd theme-toggle-useReducer
```

2. Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

3. Start the app:

```
npm run dev
```

## ðŸ“š Learnings

- Learned how to replace multiple `useState` calls with a single `useReducer`
- Gained insight into how to structure reducer functions for scalable state management
- Experienced real-world usage of action dispatching and dynamic UI styling
